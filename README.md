# Features ðŸ§©

## Interactive world map bubble chart
![map](https://github.com/hongmei-codes/covid_today/blob/master/demo/map.gif)

The dashboard features some basic information about the covid-19 cases around the world. The star ðŸŒŸ of the dashboard is the interative geo-bubble chart. You can zoom in, zoom out, navigate to which ever country or city you like. Clicking the bubbles will trigger a popup which shows the number of confirmed covid-19 cases on that day for that particular location. From a zoomed out view, bubble density visually highlights the hard hit areas.

Interact with the map at this [demo](http://h0ngm3i.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Responsive page design
![responsive](https://github.com/hongmei-codes/covid_today/blob/master/demo/responsive.gif)

The dashboard is designed to be responsive so that you can view it on any device you like. As the page width changes, the dashboard will readjust and restructure.

## Updated data
Everytime you visit the site, attemps will be made to fetch new data from [John Hopkins University's](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) latest daily report. This means you will always get the latest update!


# How was this built? ðŸ¤”
## Data Manipulation
The dataset used for the project is from [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Required data for the dashboard is cleaned and extracted using the powerful [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) library. The latitude and longitude from the dataset are used to plot bubbles on the map.

## Interactive Map  ðŸ—º
The map is created using [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium). As seen above, the map uses bubble to represent number of confirmed covid-19 cases. Greateer confirmed case numbers, means larger circles. The best thing about using folium is that it takes in pandas dataframe objects directly, so there is no need to convert pandas dataframe into other data structures.

To use follium, first install it will pip or anaconda. 
```console
$ pip install folium
```
or
```console
$ conda install folium -c conda-forge
```

Now you can create a folium map object with the code below.
```python
bubble_map = folium.Map(titles='Stamen toner')
```

Next, add bubbles to any coordinates using the   `.Circle()`  method.
```python
folium.Circle(location=[-36, 45], radius=1000, color='red').app_to(bubble_map)
```

## Web application
The data visualisation web app is created using [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask). This lighweight framework is easy to work with and can speed up the development process. That is why it was chosen for this project. Try out this web app [here](http://h0ngm3i.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Responsiveness
CSS styling is used to make the site responsive. To restructure the different components as width changes, you can use media queries.
```css
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .dash {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
```
The styling above rearranges flexboxes as columns when the screen size becomes lower than 1000px.
